# **Machine Learning Ex 3**

This repository contains an extended version of the original single-hidden-layer MLP code from Chapter 11 of the book [_Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn_ by Raschka et al. (2022)_](https://github.com/rasbt/machine-learning-book/blob/main/ch11/ch11.ipynb). The code has been revised to include **two hidden layers** from scratch, and another one using pytorch.
all three Macro-AUC scores are:

- One Layer Perceptron Micro-AUC: 0.996
- Two Layer Perceptron Micro-AUC: 0.994
- [] Two Layer Perceptron PyTorch Micro-AUC: 0.996
